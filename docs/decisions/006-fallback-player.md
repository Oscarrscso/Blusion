# ADR-006 · Fallback player for MKV, AVI, DTS and other formats AVPlayer cannot open

- **Status:** accepted; the engine is **opt-in and UNVERIFIED** until built on a Mac · **Date:** 2026-10-07 · **Node:** M6
- **Evidence:** web searches on 2026-10-07 (project READMEs, VideoLAN forums and mailing lists, package indexes). Mostly secondary sources
  and mirrors; nothing below was verified by building or running these libraries. Sources are listed at the end.

## Question

PLAN §6 M6: compare MPVKit, VLCKit and KSPlayer on license, App Store compatibility, binary size, HDR and Dolby Vision, ASS and PGS subtitles,
maintenance and SPM support, then implement one behind the `PlaybackEngine` protocol.

## Comparison (as reported; verify before relying on any cell)

| | **MPVKit** (libmpv + FFmpeg) | **VLCKit** (libVLC) | **KSPlayer** (AVPlayer + FFmpeg hybrid) |
|---|---|---|---|
| License | Two builds: **LGPL-3.0 (default)** and a GPL-3.0 build (adds Samba). Some forks are GPL-only. | LGPL-2.1+ (a VideoLAN dev: dynamic linking is fine on the App Store; use the LGPLv2 binary, not an LGPLv3 one) | **GPL by default** (obliges you to open-source your app); a **paid LGPL** license exists |
| App Store | No statement found. LGPL route is the plausible one; the GPL build is the known-bad case (VLC was pulled in 2011 over GPLv2). Open question from users: LGPL asks that users can replace the library, which App Store signing complicates. | Same LGPL question, but VLC itself ships on the App Store | GPL: no, unless you buy the license |
| SwiftPM | **Yes, first-class** (binary xcframeworks) | **No official package** (CocoaPods/Carthage; community wrappers) | Yes (depends on the author's own FFmpegKit fork) |
| Maturity / upkeep | README says it is "only suitable for learning libmpv" and "will not be maintained too frequently"; a mirror shows commits as recent as April 2026 | VLCKit 4 still alpha (4.0.0a18, Dec 2025); 3.x is the stable line | Pushes as recent as April 2026 |
| Binary size | Not published | Old numbers: ~20 MB per architecture stripped (2010s); unstripped far larger | Not published |
| HDR / Dolby Vision | Metal rendering goes through MoltenVK and "is not officially supported yet" per the README; DV profile 7 needs mpv/libplacebo commits not in releases; HDR10 via gpu-next | HDR support limited; a VideoLAN forum thread says DV is not supported on iOS | Claims HLG, HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision (largely via its AVPlayer path) |
| ASS / PGS subtitles | ASS via libass; PGS (bitmap) via FFmpeg + mpv | Both supported by VLC | ASS via libass; "text/image subtitles" |

## Decision

**MPVKit, LGPL build only.** Reasons: SwiftPM-native, which the plan requires and VLCKit lacks; an LGPL build exists, so no paid license and no GPL
obligation on a closed app (KSPlayer needs one of the two); libass and FFmpeg give the subtitle and codec coverage this app needs (MKV, AC3,
DTS, ASS, PGS); VideoToolbox hardware decoding.

Accepted risks, all recorded rather than hidden:

1. **Maintenance warning** in the upstream README. Mitigation: all library calls are in one file (`MPVBackend.swift`) behind `FallbackBackend`,
   so swapping to VLCKit (or a fork) means rewriting that file only.
2. **Rendering path** (MoltenVK) and **Dolby Vision profile 7** are weak spots. v1 plays DV profile 5/8 as the library allows and does not promise profile 7.
3. **Unmeasured binary size.** `scripts/size-report.sh` measures it on a Mac; the real number is the App Store thinning report from an archive.
4. **License sign-off is the human's** (PLAN §8, §9): see `docs/licenses.md`.

## How it is built in

- `PlayerKit` defines `FallbackBackend` (what any third-party player must provide) and `FallbackEngine` (the `PlaybackEngine` that maps backend events to
  `PlaybackState`). Both are portable and covered by host tests with a `MockBackend`, including end-to-end through `PlaybackCoordinator`.
- `Packages/FallbackPlayer` holds `MPVBackend`, guarded by `#if canImport(Libmpv)`, and declares the MPVKit dependency.
- **Opt-in:** the default `project.yml` does not reference `FallbackPlayer`. Lines marked `#fallback# ` are un-commented by
  `scripts/enable-fallback.sh` into `project.fallback.generated.yml` (adds the package, links it, defines `BLUSION_FALLBACK_ENGINE`).
  `FALLBACK=1 ./scripts/verify.sh` builds and tests that variant. Why: this build host had no Xcode, so neither the MPVKit version pin nor the
  libmpv calls could be compiled. A wrong guess must not be able to break the main app, so the main build cannot even resolve the dependency.
- Routing is the policy of PLAN §4 (with ADR-003's refinement): `PlaybackPolicy` returns `.fallback` for MKV/AVI/etc. and for DTS/TrueHD audio when
  `PolicyConfiguration.fallbackEngineAvailable` is true (engine linked **and** enabled in Settings). Otherwise the picker says "format not supported
  yet" and offers the next stream, which is today's default-build behaviour.

## What the human must do (also in `docs/MAC_FIRST_RUN.md`)

1. Build the default app first (no third-party code). Then `FALLBACK=1 ./scripts/verify.sh milestone`.
2. If SwiftPM cannot resolve MPVKit, correct the URL, product name and version in `Packages/FallbackPlayer/Package.swift`.
3. If `MPVBackend.swift` does not compile or render, fix that file only (libmpv symbol names, the `wid`/MoltenVK options).
4. Run the two MKV UI tests, `scripts/size-report.sh`, and the device checklist items; then obtain license sign-off.
